Notes on Error Handling Strategy

The importance of error handling in backend applications.
They've mentioned multiple times the need for a better error-handling strategy, and now it's time to build it.

 Key Points:
- Error handling is an essential aspect of any backend application.
- The instructor stresses why error handling deserves its own section in the course.
- In this section, Express and environment variables will be used to create a robust error-handling workflow.
- The goal is to learn how to build an error-handling system that can be reused for future applications.

Takeaway:
- Error handling is critical and will be implemented using Express and environment variables in this section.
- This workflow can be adapted for your own applications later on.

================ Debugging Node.js with ndb

# Debugging Node.js: Notes

- **Introduction**:
  - Debugging is essential as bugs will always exist, no matter how careful we are.
  - This video introduces a debugging tool (NDB) that we might use throughout the course.

- **Debugging Tools**:
  - **VS Code**: Commonly used for debugging, but NDB (Node Debugger) is a recent Google tool for this.
  - **Installation of NDB**:
    - NDB is an npm package.
    - Install globally using `npm install -g ndb`.
    - On a Mac, may require `sudo`.
    - If global installation isn't possible, install locally as a dev dependency using `npm install --save-dev ndb`.
  - Once installed, add the following script in `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "debug": "ndb server.js"
    }
    ```

- **Running the Debugger**:
  - Finish the process that is currently running to avoid port conflicts.
  - Run the script using `npm run debug`.
  - A new Chrome window (headless) opens with the Node Debugger.
  
- **Debugger Features**:
  - **File System**: The complete project directory is visible.
  - **Console**: Displays app outputs, such as database connection and app status.
  - **Memory & Performance**: Available but not covered in this video.
  - **Edit Code in Debugger**:
    - You can directly edit files from the debugger, and changes will reflect in the code.
    - Example: Added a comment in `server.js` using the debugger, saved it, and it appeared in the code editor.

- **Breakpoints**:
  - **Setting Breakpoints**: A breakpoint halts the code execution at a specific line for inspection.
    - To set a breakpoint, click next to the line number (e.g., line 21).
    - The green marker indicates a breakpoint.
  - **Running the Script Again**: Right-click and choose "Run this script" to trigger the breakpoint.
  - **Inspection**: Once paused at a breakpoint, inspect variables.
    - Example: Inspect `port`, which was set to `3000`, by hovering over it.
    - **Scope**: Shows all variables accessible in the current context (e.g., `directoryName`, `require`, etc.).

- **Exploring Variables**:
  - **App Variable**: Inspect the Express app's internal variables.
    - Look for the middleware stack (e.g., `jsonParser`, `express.static`, `morgan`).
  - **Global Variables**: 
    - Access `process` and `process.env`, which contains environment variables (e.g., database connection string, password).

- **Resuming Execution**:
  - After inspection, resume execution using the button in the debugger.
  - This continues the code execution until the next breakpoint or completes the script.

- **Example Debugging**:
  - Inspect the result of a database query by adding a breakpoint in the handler function (e.g., `getAllTours` in `tourController.js`).
  - When the breakpoint is hit, the debugger shows the request, response, and tour data.
  - **Request Object**: Shows URL, method, query parameters.
  - **Tours Data**: View the result of the query.
  - **Response Object**: Contains response properties, but focus on the tours.

- **Avoiding Console Logs**:
  - Debugger provides a more efficient way to inspect variables, eliminating the need for excessive `console.log` statements.

- **Introducing a Bug**:
  - A small bug is introduced into the code to demonstrate how the debugger can help locate issues.
  - Skip to a section of code that’s running longer than expected (3 minutes and 29 seconds in the video).

# Key Takeaways:
1. Use NDB to debug Node.js instead of relying on traditional methods like `console.log`.
2. Breakpoints allow for step-by-step debugging and inspection of variables.
3. The debugger offers real-time code editing, which can be useful for fixing issues immediately.
4. Global variables and environment variables can be accessed directly within the debugger.
5. The process of debugging with breakpoints is more efficient than traditional debugging with `console.log`.

=========================================================
================ Handling Unhandled Routes

// Notes from the video: Error handling for undefined routes

1. **Undefined Routes Handler**:
   - When a route is requested that isn't defined yet, Express returns an HTML 404 error.
   - Example:
     - If the URL is `api/tours`, and it's not defined, Express responds with a 404 error.
     - Misspelling `tour` (e.g., `api/tur`) gives the same error.
     - When the route is expecting an ID parameter, but the ID is invalid (e.g., incorrect format), it gives an error about the object ID cast failure.

2. **Current Response**:
   - By default, Express returns an HTML response with a 404 error.
   - We want to handle these cases by sending back JSON, not HTML.

3. **Fixing the Response**:
   - Open `app.js` to define error handling for undefined routes.
   - Remove any unnecessary middleware used only for demonstration purposes.

4. **Middleware Order**:
   - Express middleware runs in the order they are defined.
   - If a route handler (e.g., `tourRouter` or `userRouter`) doesn't handle a request, it reaches the final middleware.

5. **Setting up the Route Handler**:
   - Use `app.all()` to handle all HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH) for any URL.
   - The `*` wildcard represents all routes that haven't been handled yet.

6. **Sending a JSON Response**:
   - In the handler, send a 404 status code and a JSON response with a message.
   - Example:
     ```js
     res.status(404).json({
       status: 'fail',
       message: `Can't find ${req.originalUrl} on this server.`,
     });
     ```
   - `req.originalUrl` provides the requested URL.

7. **Testing the Handler**:
   - Test the handler by sending requests to undefined routes.
   - Instead of an HTML error, you get a structured JSON error message.
   - Example response:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "fail",
       "message": "Can't find /api/tours on this server."
     }
     ```

8. **Middleware Execution Order**:
   - This error handler middleware should be placed after all other route handlers.
   - If placed at the top of the application, it would catch all requests, making it impossible for other routes to be accessed.
   - Example:
     - If the error handler is placed first, all requests (e.g., `GET /tour`) will match this handler and return the JSON error.
   - The correct order ensures that this handler only runs if no other routes match.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - Proper error handling makes your API more user-friendly by providing structured JSON responses.
   - In the next section, we will focus on real error handling.

=========================================================
================ An Overview of Error Handling

// Notes from the video: Introduction to Error Handling in Express

1. **Current Error Handling Approach**:
   - So far, errors have been handled by sending an error message as JSON in each route handler when something goes wrong.
   - This is not an ideal way to manage errors in the application.

2. **Error Handling Overview in Express**:
   - The goal of this section is to improve error handling by centralizing it in the application.
   
3. **Types of Errors**:
   - **Operational Errors**:
     - These are predictable errors that occur due to user, system, or network issues.
     - Examples:
       - User accessing an invalid route.
       - Invalid user input.
       - Application failing to connect to the database.
     - These errors are expected, and we can handle them in advance.
     - "Exception" and "Error" are often used interchangeably for these kinds of errors.
   
   - **Programming Errors**:
     - These are bugs that developers introduce into the code.
     - Examples:
       - Trying to read properties from an undefined variable.
       - Using `await` without `async`.
       - Accidentally using `request.query` instead of `request.body`.
     - These are difficult to predict and harder to find, but they are inevitable.

4. **Handling Operational Errors in Express**:
   - Express is built to handle operational errors easily.
   - The key is to use **global error handling middleware** to catch errors coming from all over the application (routes, models, etc.).
   - The goal is to centralize error handling, so the application sends a nice, clear response to the client.

5. **Benefits of Global Error Handling Middleware**:
   - It provides separation of concerns. 
   - We don't need to worry about error handling in individual route handlers or business logic.
   - Instead, errors are passed down to the global error handler, which decides what to do (retry, crash, ignore, etc.).

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Now, we will start implementing the global error handling middleware in Express.

=========================================================
================ Implementing a Global Error Handling Middleware

// Notes from the video: Implementing Global Error Handling Middleware in Express

// 1. **Goal**:
//    - We need to implement a **global error handling middleware** to handle operational errors in one central place.
//    - Example of an operational error: A user hitting a non-existent URL (404 error).

// 2. **Current Approach (Problem)**:
//    - Error handling code is scattered all over the place in different routes, like this:
//      ```js
//      // Error handling in each route handler
//      if (error) {
//        res.status(500).send(error);
//      }
//      ```
//    - We want to centralize all error handling to avoid duplication and make the code cleaner.

// 3. **Creating the Error Handling Middleware**:
//    - In Express, error handling middleware is simple to implement using `app.use()`.
//    - The middleware must accept **four arguments**: `err`, `req`, `res`, `next`. Express recognizes this signature as an error handling middleware.
//      ```js
//      app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
//        // Error handling code here
//      });
//      ```

// 4. **Error Handling Middleware Structure**:
//    - **First Argument: Error (`err`)**: The error object.
//    - **Second Argument: Request (`req`)**: The request object.
//    - **Third Argument: Response (`res`)**: The response object.
//    - **Fourth Argument: Next (`next`)**: A callback function to pass control to the next middleware.
   
//    Example:
//    ```js
//    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
//      const statusCode = err.statusCode || 500; // Default to 500 if not defined
//      const status = err.status || "error"; // Default to "error" if not defined
//      res.status(statusCode).json({
//        status: status,
//        message: err.message,
//      });
//    });
//    ```

// 5. **Setting Default Error Status and Code**:
//    - If no status code is provided in the error, default to **500 (Internal Server Error)**.
//    - If no status is provided, default to **"error"**.
//    ```js
//    const statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;
//    const status = err.status || "error";
//    ```

// 6. **Creating and Throwing an Error**:
//    - You can create an error using JavaScript's built-in `Error` constructor:
//      ```js
//      const err = new Error("Route not found");
//      err.status = "fail";
//      err.statusCode = 404;
//      ```
//    - This error is then passed to the next middleware with `next(err)` to trigger the global error handler.

// 7. **Using `next(err)`**:
//    - When you pass an error to `next()`, Express will skip all remaining middlewares and pass control to the global error handler.
//      ```js
//      next(err);  // Pass the error to the global error handler
//      ```

// 8. **Testing the Error Handler**:
//    - To test the global error handler, try accessing a non-existing route. It will trigger a 404 error and the middleware will send the appropriate response.
//      ```js
//      // Non-existing route:
//      app.get('/wrong-route', (req, res, next) => {
//        const err = new Error("Route not found");
//        err.status = "fail";
//        err.statusCode = 404;
//        next(err);
//      });
//      ```

// The above steps create a simple, centralized error handler to handle operational errors in your application.


=========================================================
================ Better Errors and Refactoring

// Notes from the video: Creating a Better AppError Class and Refactoring

// 1. **Creating AppError Class**:
//    - Let's create a new file in the Utilities folder called **AppError** to hold our custom error class.
//    - The AppError class will extend the built-in JavaScript **Error** class.
//    - By extending the **Error** class, we can utilize the built-in functionality of errors in JavaScript.

class AppError extends Error {
    constructor(message, statusCode) {
        super(message); // Call parent class constructor with the message
        this.statusCode = statusCode; // Set status code
        this.status = statusCode.toString().startsWith('4') ? 'fail' : 'error'; // Auto-detect fail or error based on the statusCode
        this.isOperational = true; // Mark it as operational error
        Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor); // Capture stack trace excluding this constructor
    }
}

// 2. **Constructor Details**:
//    - The **constructor** is called each time an object is created from the AppError class.
//    - The constructor takes two parameters: `message` and `statusCode`.
//    - **super(message)** is called to pass the message to the parent class (Error), which sets the `message` property on the error.


// 3. **Status Code and Status**:
//    - The `statusCode` is passed into the AppError constructor and determines the error type.
//    - If the status code starts with '4' (like 400), it's considered a 'fail' status, otherwise, it’s an 'error'.
//    - This makes error classification automatic, saving us from manually passing in 'fail' or 'error' each time.


// 4. **Operational Errors**:
//    - This class is designed for **operational errors**, which are predictable errors (e.g., invalid user input).
//    - We add a property `isOperational` to mark these as operational errors for easier filtering later.

// 5. **Capturing Stack Trace**:
//    - The **stack trace** shows the error's location in the code.
//    - By using `Error.captureStackTrace()`, we ensure the stack trace is captured without polluting it with the current class constructor.
   
// 6. **Exporting the AppError Class**:
//    - Finally, we **export** the AppError class so that it can be used throughout the application.

module.exports = AppError;

// 7. **Using AppError**:
//    - In other parts of the application, we can now create errors using the AppError class:
//      ```js
//      const error = new AppError('Invalid data', 400);
//      next(error); // Pass the error to the global error handler
//      ```

// 8. **Refactoring the Error Handling**:
//    - We refactor the code to replace manual error creation with `new AppError(message, statusCode)`.
//    - This simplifies error handling and ensures consistency throughout the app.

// 9. **Global Error Handler**:
//    - The error handler should be added to catch all operational errors created using AppError. We now need to move this handler to a separate controller.

// 10. **Error Controller**:
//     - We create an **errorController** to manage different error handling functions.
//     - While it might seem unconventional to create an error controller, it helps us organize error handling logic for the entire application.


// 11. **Final Steps**:
//     - In the app, we import the **globalErrorHandler** from the error controller and use it as middleware.
//     - The middleware will handle all operational errors in a centralized manner.

// Final testing: The refactoring works as expected, and the error handling is simplified and more consistent across the app.



=========================================================
================ Catching Errors in Async Functions

// In this lecture, we are going to refactor our error handling for async functions
// Currently, every async function has a try-catch block, but this makes the code messy and repetitive.

// Goal: Remove duplicate try-catch blocks and make the code more focused and cleaner.

// Solution: Create a utility function `catchAsync` to wrap async functions and handle errors globally.

// Step-by-Step:

1. **Create a catchAsync function**
   - This function will take an async function as an argument, handle its errors, and pass them to the global error handler.

2. **Function Definition:**
   const catchAsync = (fn) => {
       return (req, res, next) => {
           fn(req, res, next).catch(next);
       };
   };

3. **Wrap Async Functions with catchAsync:**
   - Inside any async function, such as `createTour`, we remove the try-catch block and wrap it with `catchAsync`.

   Example:
   ```js
   // Instead of this:
   try {
       const tour = await Tour.create(req.body);
       res.status(201).json({ tour });
   } catch (error) {
       next(error);
   }

   // We now use catchAsync:
   const createTour = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
       const tour = await Tour.create(req.body);
       res.status(201).json({ tour });
   });

4. How catchAsync works:
  - The async function (like createTour) is passed as fn into catchAsync.
  - The catchAsync function returns a new anonymous function that Express can call.
  - Inside that function, fn is executed, and if any errors occur, they are caught using .catch(next) and passed to the global error handler.

5. Issues to Fix:
  - We need to ensure req, res, and next are properly passed to the wrapped function.
  - In the previous implementation, createTour was being immediately executed. We need to make sure that it's only called when Express triggers it.

6. Final Solution:
  - The catchAsync function returns a new anonymous function that Express calls when needed, and inside that function, the original async function (fn) is called.
  - Errors are caught by .catch(next) and passed to the global error handler.

7. Export catchAsync:
  - Move the catchAsync function to its own file, e.g., catchAsync.js, in the utilities folder.
  - In the controller, import and use catchAsync for each async function.

8. Testing:
  - If an error occurs (e.g., invalid input), it will be caught by the catch block in catchAsync.
  - The error will be passed to the global error handler and a proper error response will be sent back to the client.

9. Refactor all async functions:
  - Replace the try-catch blocks in all async controller functions with catchAsync.
  - Add next to all handlers, ensuring that the error is passed to the global error handler.

10. Note:
  - The 500 status code is default when no specific code is provided. We’ll address that in a later lecture.

11. Final Result:
  - We successfully removed the duplicate try-catch blocks and made our error handling more centralized and cleaner.
  - The error is now propagated through the catchAsync function to the global error handler.


=========================================================
================ Adding 404 Not Found Errors

- We are going to add 404 errors to our tour handler functions using the AppError class.

- Instead of using `catchAsync` in the router, it's easier to wrap async functions with it directly in the controller.

- **Why not use catchAsync in the router?**
  - If we use `catchAsync` in the router, we have to remember which functions are async and which are not.
  - In the controller, every time we write an async function, we know it needs to be wrapped in `catchAsync`, making it simpler.

- Example: I once ran into a bug where I wrapped a non-async function in `catchAsync`, causing issues that were difficult to debug. Since then, I avoid putting `catchAsync` in the router and prefer to place it close to the code that is actually asynchronous.

- Now, let's implement 404 errors for "tour not found."

### Handling 404 Error:

- **Scenario**: When trying to get a tour with a valid but non-existing MongoDB ID, we get `null`, but we want a 404 error with a message saying "No tour found with that ID."
  
- **Solution**: 
  1. In the `getTour` handler, check if the tour is null. If it is, we create an error using `AppError` and pass it to the next middleware.
  
  2. Example:
     ```js
     if (!tour) {
         return next(new AppError('No tour found with that ID', 404));
     }
     ```

- **Important**: Always return after calling `next` to avoid sending multiple responses.

- **Importing AppError**: 
  - Ensure the `AppError` class is imported at the top of the controller.

- **Test the functionality**: 
  - Use a non-existent ID in the request to test the 404 error and ensure it returns the correct message.

### Implementing 404 Error in Other Handlers:

- Similarly, implement error handling in `updateTour` and `deleteTour` handlers:
  1. Check if the tour exists before performing the operation.
  2. Example:
     ```js
     const tour = await Tour.findById(id);
     if (!tour) {
         return next(new AppError('No tour found with that ID', 404));
     }
     ```

- **ESLint Error**: 
  - In `deleteTour`, ESLint flagged an error because `tour` wasn’t defined. It saved me from creating a bug.
  - To fix this, we simply need to store the result of the `Tour.findByIdAndDelete` operation in the `tour` variable.

- **Why no 404 in `getAllTours`?**
  - When no records are found (e.g., filtering tours or an empty page), returning a 404 is incorrect since the request was valid and returned zero results.
  - Instead, send a 200 status with an empty array or no data message.
  - If there’s a database failure, Mongoose will throw an error, which is caught by `catchAsync` and passed to the global error handler.

=========================================================
================ Errors During Development vs Production

- In this video, we're implementing logic for different error messages in the development and production environments.

- Right now, we are sending the same response message to everyone, regardless of the environment (development or production).

- The goal is:
  - In **production**, minimize error details to avoid exposing sensitive information to the client.
  - In **development**, provide full error details (including error stack) for debugging purposes.

- **Distinguishing between environments**:
  - Use `process.env.NODE_ENV` to check if the environment is **development** or **production**.

- **In development**:
  - Send detailed error information like `err.stack` and the entire `error`.

- **In production**:
  - Send a simpler error response: only the status and the message (no stack trace or full error details).

- To keep the code clean, create separate functions to handle errors for both environments:
  - `sendErrorForDev` for development.
  - `sendErrorForProd` for production.

- **AppError Class**:
  - Errors created using the `AppError` class are marked as operational (`isOperational: true`).

- **Operational vs Non-Operational Errors**:
  - Operational errors are those that are expected, such as user input errors or trying to access a non-existent route.
  - Non-operational errors are unexpected, such as programming bugs or third-party package issues.

- **Handling Operational Errors**:
  - For operational errors, send the error message to the client in production (after checking `error.isOperational`).

- **Handling Non-Operational Errors**:
  - For unexpected errors, send a generic message like "Something went wrong" in production.
  - Log the error to the console for developers to debug.

- **Logging Errors**:
  - Use `console.error` to log unexpected errors in the development environment.
  - Use logging tools in production (e.g., Heroku logs) to track these errors.

- **Recap**:
  - In **development**, send detailed error information to help developers fix bugs.
  - In **production**, send simple error messages, but log detailed errors for the developer's reference.
  - Differentiate between operational and non-operational errors to control how much error information is sent to the client.

- **Important**:
  - MongoDB errors like validation errors are currently not marked as operational, so we need to mark them as operational to handle them correctly in the error flow.


=========================================================
================ Handling Invalid Database IDs

// Notes on Mongoose Error Handling - Operational Errors

// There are 3 types of errors we need to handle in Mongoose:

1. **Invalid ID (CastError)**:
   - Example: Passing an invalid ID to Mongoose.
   - Mongoose can't convert this into a valid MongoDB ID.
   - This results in an error with an extensive error object, stack trace, etc.
   - In production, we need to return a meaningful error message, not the full error object.

   // Steps to handle:
   - **Identify** the error with `err.name === 'CastError'`.
   - **Create a function** to handle the error and return a readable message, e.g., `Invalid ID: [value]`.

2. **Duplicate Field (Duplicate Key Error)**:
   - Example: Trying to create a tour with a name that's already taken.
   - Mongoose throws a `duplicate key error` (e.g., Forest Hiker already exists).
   - In production, return a meaningful message, such as "Tour name already exists."

3. **Validation Error (Invalid Value for Field)**:
   - Example: Updating a field with an invalid value, e.g., a rating average of 6 (max 5).
   - Mongoose throws a `ValidationError` with a detailed object of errors.
   - Multiple fields may have validation issues (e.g., ratings, difficulty level).
   - In production, handle by providing a meaningful response indicating the validation failure.

---

// Creating Error Handlers:

// 1. Handle CastError (Invalid ID):

// Define a function for CastError handling.
function handleCastError(err) {
    let error = { ...err }; // Create a copy to avoid overriding the original error object.
    
    const message = `Invalid ${err.path}: ${err.value}`; // Construct a custom error message.

    // Create a new AppError with a 400 status code (Bad Request).
    error = new AppError(message, 400);
    return error;
}

// 2. Apply the Error Handling:

// In production, check if the error is a CastError and handle it:
if (err.name === 'CastError') {
    err = handleCastError(err);
}

// Return the error using a utility function (sendErrorProd) that formats the response for clients.

---

// Production Setup:

// Use a "start:prod" script to run in production mode:
// Run: `npm run start:prod` to simulate error handling in production.
 
// Example response for invalid ID:
{
    "status": "fail",
    "message": "Invalid ID: [invalidID]",
    "statusCode": 400
}

// Conclusion:
// - Handle operational errors (like CastError, duplicate key, and validation) gracefully in production.
// - Always return a clear, user-friendly error message instead of internal error details.

=========================================================
================ Handling Duplicate Database Fields

// Notes from the video on handling duplicate fields error

// Handling duplicate fields error that occurs when a field is supposed to be unique
// The error occurs when we try to create a new document with a name that already exists

// Duplicate field error does not have a 'name' property (because it's caused by MongoDB, not Mongoose)

// The error code we need to check is 11000

// To handle this, we'll create a handler function for the error with code 11000
// The handler function will be called 'handleDuplicateFields'

// Create a meaningful error message to send back to the client
// The message will say: "Duplicate field value: <value>"

// To extract the duplicate field value (like the name), we'll use a regular expression
// The value is enclosed in quotes, so we can use a regular expression to find text between quotes

// Use a regular expression to match text between quotes
// Search for: "regular expression match text between quotes" on Google

// Use the following regular expression pattern:
// /"([^"]*)"/

// In the code:
const value = error.errmsg; // The error property that contains the message
const regex = /"([^"]*)"/; // Regular expression to match text between quotes
const match = value.match(regex); // Match the value

// If the match is successful, extract the first element of the array (the value inside quotes)
const extractedValue = match[1];

// Create a new AppError instance with a 400 status code and a custom message
const message = `Duplicate field value: "${extractedValue}". Please use another value.`;
return new AppError(message, 400);

// Now the client will receive a more meaningful error message like:
// "Duplicate field value: "The Forest Hiker". Please use another value."

// In the next video, we'll handle the last of the three errors: validation errors.

=========================================================
================ Handling Mongoose Validation Errors

// Notes from the video on handling Mongoose validation errors

// Handling Mongoose validation errors when invalid data is sent (e.g., a short name for a tour)

// In production, we might not see the detailed error message, but we can switch back to development mode
// (npm start) to see the error in a more detailed format

// The error object contains a property 'errors' that holds individual field error objects
// Each error has a message for the field (e.g., name, difficulty, rating)

// We want to extract all error messages and combine them into one string

// Step-by-step guide:

// 1. Check if the error is a Mongoose validation error by looking at error.name
if (error.name === "ValidationError") {
  // 2. Pass the error to a custom function: handleValidationErrorDB
  error = handleValidationErrorDB(error);

  // 3. Create an initial message for the error
  const message = "Invalid input data. ";

  // 4. Loop over all the error messages and extract them
  const errors = Object.values(error.errors).map(el => el.message);

  // 5. Join all error messages into one string with a period and space
  const errorMessage = errors.join(". ");

  // 6. Return the error as a new AppError with a 400 status code
  return new AppError(`${message}${errorMessage}`, 400);
}

// Example:
// Invalid input data. "Name must have more or equal than 10 characters". "Difficulty is invalid". "Rating is required"

// In production, you will now see a nicely formatted error message with all field errors combined
// "Invalid input data. Name must have more or equal than 10 characters. Difficulty is invalid. Rating is required."

// Further improvements:
  // - We could define error severity levels (e.g., low, medium, high)
  // - Could implement notifications for critical errors (e.g., email admins)
  
// The current solution is robust enough for small applications
// In case more operational errors are identified, we can add handling for them using a similar approach

// This completes the error controller logic for Mongoose validation errors.

================ Errors Outside Express_ Unhandled Rejections

// Notes on Unhandled Promise Rejections in Node.js

// 1. Handling Errors in Express  
// - Errors are passed to global error-handling middleware.
// - This middleware sends relevant messages to the client depending on the error type.

// 2. Unhandled Errors Outside Express  
// - Errors can occur outside Express, like in MongoDB connection.
// - These errors won't be caught by Express' error handler.
 
// Example: Simulating an error by changing MongoDB password
// (this will cause an unhandled promise rejection)

// 3. What is an Unhandled Promise Rejection?  
// - An unhandled promise rejection occurs when a promise is rejected 
//   but not handled using .catch() or try-catch blocks.
// - Node.js issues a deprecation warning for unhandled rejections.
// - Future versions of Node may terminate the process for unhandled rejections.


// 4. Fix for Handling Rejections  
// - The easiest fix is adding a .catch() handler to the rejected promise.

mongoose.connect(mongoURI)
  .then(() => console.log('Connected'))
  .catch(err => console.log(err)); // Handling rejection

// 5. Global Handling of Unhandled Rejections  
// - For larger apps, manually handling rejections for every promise can be difficult.
// - We can handle all unhandled rejections globally using process.on('unhandledRejection').

process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {
  console.log(`Unhandled rejection: ${err.name} - ${err.message}`);
});

=========================================================
================ Catching Uncaught Exceptions

// Notes on Catching Uncaught Exceptions in Node.js

// 1. What Are Uncaught Exceptions?  
// - Uncaught exceptions are errors (bugs) that occur in synchronous code and 
//   are not handled anywhere in the code.
// - These errors can crash the application if not handled.

// 2. Example of an Uncaught Exception  
// - An error occurs when attempting to use an undefined variable (e.g., x is not defined).
// - The error causes a stack trace to be printed in the console.

// 3. Handling Uncaught Exceptions  
// - Node.js provides a way to handle uncaught exceptions using the uncaughtException event.

// Example:  
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  console.log('UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION! Shutting down...');
  console.log(err.name, err.message); // Log error name and message
  process.exit(1); // Gracefully shut down the server
});

// 4. Graceful Shutdown After Uncaught Exception  
// - After an uncaught exception occurs, it is important to shut down the application 
//   and restart it, as Node.js enters an unclean state after an uncaught exception.

// 5. The Order of Event Handlers  
// - It is important to place the uncaughtException handler at the top of the code 
//   before any other code executes to catch errors that occur earlier in the code.

// 6. Uncaught Exceptions in Express  
// - If an uncaught exception happens inside Express middleware, Express's error-handling 
//   middleware will catch it and handle it appropriately, depending on the environment (production or development).

// 7. Best Practices  
// - While unhandled rejections and uncaught exception handlers can be useful safety nets, 
//   errors should ideally be handled where they occur (e.g., add .catch() for promises).
// - Relying on global error handlers should be avoided unless necessary.

// 8. Final Thoughts  
// - Proper error handling is essential for building reliable applications.
// - This section covers the basics of handling unhandled rejections and uncaught exceptions.
// - Error handling can be more complex, but understanding these essentials will help you get started.
